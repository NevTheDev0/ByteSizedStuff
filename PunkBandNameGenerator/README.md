# Punk Band Name Generator
> A chaotic little app made with Streamlit. Part boredom, part brilliance. Use it to generate trashy, violent, microwave-worthy punk band names on demand.

### 🧪 Try It Out 
Not everyone wants to mess with code — here's the app:   
[Punk Band Name Generator](https://punkbandnamegenerator.streamlit.app/)

### How to use the Repo(Idek why you would wanna do this)
If you would like to just clone it and idk use it for yourself that's cool and fine 
Here's how to do it if you ever decide to do that:  
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ByteSizedStuff/PunkBandNameGenerator.git
cd PunkBandNameGenerator
```
2. If you haven't installed streamlit yet:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the streamlit app:
```
streamlit run PBNGRAW.py
```


### 🧠 What's Inside?
- **First names** are just a bunch of random adjectives and nouns, you know the punk band stuff
- **Last names** are a bunch of random words
- **Optional stuff** includes names that are associated with punk, because they sometimes have like more than 3 words 
  
It will randomly mash them together so I've added some functionality to it like:
- 💾 Saving your banger punk band names
- ⏳ Viewing past names in case you wanted to see previous names or you accidentally pressed the generate button (dw, I do this too)

### 🤘 Why?
It was mainly a mini project to refresh me on streamlit, but hey it was fun, it will also prevent you from naming your band "Cigarettes after sex" or some weird stuff like that (no offense ykim)

### 🛑 Real Talk
-  `PBNGRAW.py` is dumb I know, I couldn't fit a whole sentence in a file name, but this is the pure logic, if you ever need it
- This is pretty minimal, because its a mini project, don't expect regular updates or a random ChatGPT wrapper startup thing
- Use it all you want, but please shout me out if you ever become famous!
